# 📊 Plotter

## 🎯 Project Overview
Plotter is a versatile data visualization tool designed to generate multiple types of plots based on user input. It supports various input methods including random generation, customized input, and file uploads. Users can create up to 7 different plots based on their data, with error handling for specific plot types.

## 🛠️ Features
  Input Data

  Random input generation
- Customized input (specify rows and columns)
- File upload for data input
- Plot Categories

 Full Data Visualization:
- Generate 6 different types of plots based on the entire dataset.
  
Column-Specific Visualization: 
- Generate up to 7 plots per category, with error handling for bubble and surface plots.
- Error Handling

Manages errors in data input and plot generation.

## 🖥️ Algorithm
1. Data Input

2. Options:
   - Random input, customized input (rows and columns), file upload.
   - Error handling for invalid data inputs.
   - Category Selection

3. Full data visualization: Generates 6 distinct plots.
   
Column-specific visualization:

1 Column: Generates up to 7 plots with error handling.

2 Columns: Generates up to 7 plots with user-defined input.

3 Columns: Generates up to 7 plots with user-defined input.

4. Plot Generation
Handles the generation of various plots while managing errors for specific types like bubble and surface plots.
