# Coffee Machine Project

## Description

Welcome to the Coffee Machine Project! â˜• This project is a delightful implementation of a coffee machine that lets you savor various coffee options, check resources, and view real-time reports of the machine's status.

## Usage

To brew your perfect cup, follow these simple steps:

1. Enter your coffee choice (latte, espresso, cappuccino) or type "off" to gracefully power down the machine.
2. For a detailed machine status report, type "report."

## Features

- Multiple coffee options (latte, espresso, cappuccino)
- Smart resource management (water, milk, coffee)
- Real-time reporting of machine status and profit

## Algorithm

The Coffee Machine Project dances through a graceful algorithm, orchestrating the symphony of order processing, resource management, and reporting:

1. **Order Processing:**
   - Users choose their desired coffee, and the program checks resource availability with the `check_resources` function.
   - Successful orders prompt users to input coins, processed with `process_coins` and `is_payment_successful` functions.
   - With a successful payment, the `make_coffee` function crafts the perfect cup, deducting resources.

2. **Resource Management:**
   - The `resources` dictionary (water, milk, coffee) is the heart of resource management.
   - Coffee orders gracefully deduct the required resources using the `make_coffee` function.

3. **Reporting:**
   - Users can request a symphony of data with a "report" command, revealing the harmony of water, milk, coffee levels, and total profits.

4. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop's rhythm continues as long as the machine is on (`is_on` is True).
   - Users can conclude the caffeinated symphony by typing "off."

5. **Profit Tracking:**
   - The `profit` variable crescendos with each successful payment, representing the symphony's total earnings.

This algorithm ensures a delightful user experience, orchestrating order processing, resource management, and reporting with grace and efficiency.
